## Film-Buff Chatbot: Your AI-Powered Movie Assistant

Tired of jumping between different sites for movie trivia, ratings, and good recommendations? This project solves that problem. The **Film-Buff Chatbot** is an interactive, conversational assistant that bundles all those tasks into one place.

## The Technical Reel: How It's Built

The chatbot is built on a multi-stage pipeline that collects, processes, and queries movie data.

### 1. Building the Knowledge Base

The process starts by creating a dynamic and rich dataset:

- Fetches a list of the **top 250 popular movie titles** using the TMDB API.
- For each title, retrieves detailed metadata including **plot, genre, release year, and IMDb rating** from the OMDb API.
- Cleans the data to handle missing values and duplicates.
- The result is a structured pandas data frame ready for embedding and querying.

### 2. Enabling Semantic Understanding with a Vector Store

To power movie recommendations:

- Each movie’s **plot summary** is converted into a **numerical embedding** using Google’s `text-embedding-004` model.
- Embeddings are stored in a **ChromaDB vector database**.
- This setup enables **semantic similarity search**, allowing the chatbot to recommend films with similar plots.

### 3. Poster Analysis with Multimodal Vision

- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to "see" and analyze movie posters.
- Extracts the **top five dominant hex colors** from poster images.
- Returns a visual **color palette** that reflects the aesthetic tone of the movie.

### 4. The Conversational Agent & Custom Tools

The core of the chatbot is powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, configured as a conversational agent.

It leverages custom Python tools to perform complex actions beyond simple text generation:

#### Key Tools
- `get_movie_info()`: Fetches title, plot, year, and IMDb rating from the database.
- `recommend_movies()`: Finds semantically similar films using ChromaDB embeddings.
- `get_reviews()`: Summarizes recent, real-world reviews using **Google Search grounding**, with citation footnotes.
- `show_palette()`: Extracts and displays the poster’s color palette using multimodal vision.
- Also there are tools for **genre filtering, year search, trailer links**, and **cast lookups**.
